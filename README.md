# CS312-P2
CS312 Course Project Part 2
## Background
Our company is trying to get the employee Minecraft server up and running again after the unfortunate fiasco with some naughty NSFW browsing by our last dev. This time around we will be looking to make the set up a little more automatic by setting up scripts that will auto deploy our EC2 instances and automatically install our server on it in case we happen to lose another dev to the entrapment of internet debauchery. The way we will automate this is by using code as infrastructure with tools like Terraform and Ansible. 
## Requirements
### Tools
The tools that will be required to set up our EC2 instance and Minecraft Server:
- Terraform version 1.5 or later
- Ansible version 2.14 or later
- AWS CLI with configured profile
- OpenSSH
- Python 3 (latest version)
